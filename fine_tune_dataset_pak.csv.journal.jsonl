Data sovereignty: Storing data abroad exposes it to foreign laws and regulations, which could limit access or subject it to surveillance.\n\n2. Geopolitical tensions: In times of political instability or conflict, data centers in other countries may become vulnerable or inaccessible.\n\n3. Physical security risks: Offshore data centers may face different physical threats, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks on infrastructure, or theft of sensitive equipment.\n\n4. Service level agreements (SLAs): Storing data outside Pakistan increases the risk that SLAs with cloud providers may not be enforceable due to legal jurisdiction issues.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, GOP should ensure compliance with relevant international privacy and security standards, as well as engage in regular risk assessments and communication with their cloud provider."}
