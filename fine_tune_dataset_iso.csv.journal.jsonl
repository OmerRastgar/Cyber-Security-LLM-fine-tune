Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Divisional Structure**: Each division operates independently under a division manager. This can lead to better focus on specific markets or products, but may result in less coordination with other departments.\n\n2. **Functional Structure**: Departments are organized based on shared functions like production, HR, or marketing. This promotes efficiency and expertise within each function, but might create silos that hinder cross-functional collaboration.\n\n3. **Matrix Structure**: A blend of divisional and functional structures, where employees report to both a functional manager and a project/division manager. This structure fosters flexibility and adaptability, but can also lead to complexity and potential conflicts in decision-making.\n\nIn summary, an organization's structure significantly impacts its relationships with outside agents and the quality of products/services provided. Different structures have their advantages and disadvantages, and organizations need to carefully evaluate their needs before choosing a structure."}

Implement an automated or manual process to verify consistency between virtual and physical network configurations based on the defined policy.\n4. Regularly review and update the information security policy as needed to reflect changes in technology, regulations, or business requirements.\n\nBy following these steps, the cloud service provider can ensure that their virtual network configuration adheres to their established information security policy."}

Cloud Service Customer:\n   - May be responsible for setting up and managing their own virtual networks.\n   - Depending on the service level agreement (SLA), may need to configure security groups or network policies.\n\n2. Cloud Service Provider:\n   - Generally, cloud service providers handle the underlying infrastructure, including virtual networking.\n   - However, in some cases, they might offer managed services for virtual network configuration, particularly for complex scenarios or enterprise customers.\n\nIt's important to note that these responsibilities can change based on the specific cloud service and the terms of the agreement between the customer and the provider."}
