Key steps include:\n\n1. **Image Selection**: The CSP must source images from reputable sources or create their own hardened images.\n\n2. **Hardening Process**: Images must undergo hardening processes, which may involve applying security patches, configuring firewalls, and implementing other security best practices.\n\n3. **Third-Party Software**: While hardened images are preferred, the CSP can still leverage third-party software within containers as long as it is properly secured.\n\n4. **Validation by 3PAO**: A crucial part of this process is the validation by an independent Third Party Auditor (3PAO). The 3PAO ensures that the CSP's hardening processes meet FedRAMP requirements for baseline controls.\n\nIn summary, the CSP must implement strict image selection and hardening procedures. Additionally, regular validation by a 3PAO ensures compliance with FedRAMP requirements."}
