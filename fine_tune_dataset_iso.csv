1. Intrinsic vulnerabilities: These are inherent weaknesses in the asset itself, such as design flaws or insufficient security features.

2. Extrinsic vulnerabilities: These arise from external factors, like outdated software, weak passwords, or unpatched systems.

3. Misuse of controls: Controls can be ineffective if they are not properly implemented, maintained, or used by employees.

4. Malfunctioning controls: When a control is designed to prevent a certain threat, but it fails to do so, it becomes a vulnerability.

These vulnerabilities need to be identified and managed as part of an organization's cybersecurity strategy."

Here are some key points:

1. **Divisional Structure**: Each division operates independently under a division manager. This can lead to better focus on specific markets or products, but may result in less coordination with other departments.

2. **Functional Structure**: Departments are organized based on shared functions like production, HR, or marketing. This promotes efficiency and expertise within each function, but might create silos that hinder cross-functional collaboration.

3. **Matrix Structure**: A blend of divisional and functional structures, where employees report to both a functional manager and a project/division manager. This structure fosters flexibility and adaptability, but can also lead to complexity and potential conflicts in decision-making.

In summary, an organization's structure significantly impacts its relationships with outside agents and the quality of products/services provided. Different structures have their advantages and disadvantages, and organizations need to carefully evaluate their needs before choosing a structure."

2. **Value comparison**: Compare the value of the dependent asset with the asset it depends on. If the former is lower or equal, no change to the asset value.

3. **Impact-based adjustments**: If the dependent asset's value is greater, adjust the value of the asset it depends on according to:
   - Degree of dependency.
   - Values of other assets in the organization.

By following this process, the organization ensures that asset values accurately reflect their dependencies and the broader impact of security incidents."

Here's how it works:

1. Assign asset values: Each asset is given a value based on its importance in terms of potential adverse consequences.

2. Assess likelihood values: The likelihood of each threat occurring, as well as the ease of exploitation, are combined to determine a likelihood value.

3. Calculate asset/threat scores: By intersecting the asset value and likelihood value for each threat, an asset/threat score is assigned.

4. Summarize total scores: Asset total scores are calculated by summing up all the asset/threat scores for each asset.

This systematic approach ensures that threats can be objectively compared and prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence."

1. Cloud Service Customer:
   - May be responsible for setting up and managing their own virtual networks.
   - Depending on the service level agreement (SLA), may need to configure security groups or network policies.

2. Cloud Service Provider:
   - Generally, cloud service providers handle the underlying infrastructure, including virtual networking.
   - However, in some cases, they might offer managed services for virtual network configuration, particularly for complex scenarios or enterprise customers.

It's important to note that these responsibilities can change based on the specific cloud service and the terms of the agreement between the customer and the provider."

* Cloud Service Customer:
   - May be responsible for setting up and managing their own virtual networks.
   - This could include tasks like defining security groups, assigning IP addresses, and configuring routing.

* Cloud Service Provider:
   - Often plays a more technical role in supporting virtual network configurations.
   - Providers may handle tasks such as maintaining the underlying infrastructure, implementing network policies, or offering tools for customers to manage their networks.

The specific division of responsibilities can depend on the type of cloud service being used."
