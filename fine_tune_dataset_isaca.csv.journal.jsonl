In this scenario:\n\n- Risk appetite is defined at a level that aligns with the enterprise's risk tolerance and ability to absorb losses.\n\n- Risk capacity, or the objective magnitude of loss an enterprise can tolerate, remains below or equal to the risk appetite.\n\nIn contrast, an unsustainable situation occurs when risk appetite exceeds risk capacity. This imbalance can lead to:\n\n- Uncontrolled risks: The enterprise may take on more risk than it can handle, potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.\n\n- Insufficient mitigation measures: With a higher risk appetite, enterprises might not invest enough in risk management controls and contingency plans.\n\nIn summary, a sustainable situation with risk management ensures that risk appetite aligns with the enterprise's capacity to absorb losses. An unsustainable situation occurs when risk appetite exceeds capacity, potentially leading to uncontrolled risks and inadequate mitigation measures."}
